I am a second year Robotics Master's student in the [General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception (GRASP) Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/) and [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked with [Prof. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](https://vorobeychik.com/).

My research focuses on the intersection of learning-based methods and control theory for robotics, with the goal of enabling robots to <b>safely</b> and <b>intelligently</b> interact with the physical world.
