I am a second year Robotics Master's student in the [General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception (GRASP) Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/) and [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). My research interest lie at the intersection of Robot Learning and Control Theory as applied to robotic manipulation ðŸ¦¾. My ultimate goal is to enable robots to understand and interact with the physical world both <b>safely</b> and <b>intelligently</b>.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked with [Prof. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](https://vorobeychik.com/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
