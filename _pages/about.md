I am a second year Robotics Master's student in the [General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception (GRASP) Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/) and [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked with [Prof. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](https://vorobeychik.com/).

<b>My research focuses broadly on the <b>generalization of learning-based robot policies</b></b> ðŸ¦¾.
