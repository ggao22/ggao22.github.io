  title={Out-of-Distribution Recovery with Object-Centric Keypoint Inverse Policy For Visuomotor Imitation Learning}, 
  author={Gao, George Jiayuan and Li, Tianyu and Figueroa, Nadia},
  abstract={We propose an object-centric recovery policy framework to address the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in visuomotor policy learning. Previous behavior cloning (BC) methods rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data coverage, failing in unfamiliar spatial states. Without relying on extra data collection, our approach learns a recovery policy constructed by an inverse policy inferred from object keypoint manifold gradient in the original training data. The recovery policy serves as a simple add-on to any base visuomotor BC policy, agnostic to a specific method, guiding the system back towards the training distribution to ensure task success even in OOD situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our object-centric framework in both simulation and real robot experiments, achieving an improvement of 77.7% over the base policy in OOD. },
